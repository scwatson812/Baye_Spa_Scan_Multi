The file BSSM.R implements the Bayesian spatial scan statistic for multinomial data.

The file NullSims.R implements simulations under the null hypothesis to determine the appropriate Bayes factor threshold for rejection of the null hypothesis.

DataFile.csv is an example of how the data should be formatted.
The Observation ID column should contain a unique ID for each multinomial observation.
The next K columns (Category 1,...,Category K) should contain the mulitnomial counts for each category for each observation.
The next M columns (Zone 1, ..., Zone M) should contain a 1 if the observations in that row falls into that zone and 0 otherwise.
